Chart definition vs values.yaml:

    Move image source/target details from chart to values
    (IMG_SOURCE/IMG_TARGET)

    Move the VM definitions entirely into the values.yaml file; have
    helm deployment process iterate over that creating multiple pods,
    one for each VM.

    Ideally this will allow incremental updates of pods without having
    to know about the chart internals.

Add Dockerfile; update the container image we use to Ubuntu 16.04 with
a suitable KVM/Qemu.

Consider moving to stateful sets for cleaner PVC associations.  See
OSH MariaDB chart for an example of this.
